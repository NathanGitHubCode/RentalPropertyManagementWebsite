  <p>
      Our company was founded in 1956 out of Perry Ellis Island. Our founders, Rashu & Taboo , were a couple of entrepreneurs who saw a need for reliable rental property management services in their community. They started small, with just a few properties, but quickly grew their business through their hard work and dedication to their craft.

      Over the years, we have expanded our operations to include a wide variety of rental properties, from single-family homes to large apartment buildings. We now manage properties in several different cities, and are proud to be one of the leading rental property management companies in the area. Despite our growth, we have never lost sight of the values that our founders instilled in us, and we continue to provide the same high level of service that we did when we first started.

      At our company, we are committed to providing our tenants with safe, affordable, and well-maintained housing options. We understand that finding the right rental property can be a daunting task, which is why we make it our mission to provide our tenants with as much information as possible about each of our properties. From detailed descriptions to high-quality photos, we want our tenants to be able to make an informed decision when choosing a home.

      In addition to offering a wide range of properties, we also provide our tenants with a number of services to make their rental experience as smooth as possible. Our team is available 24/7 to handle any maintenance issues that may arise, and we have an online portal where tenants can pay rent, submit maintenance requests, and access important documents. We are always looking for new ways to improve our services, and are dedicated to providing our tenants with the best possible experience.

      As a company, we are also committed to giving back to our community. We believe in supporting local organizations and charities, and regularly participate in community events and fundraisers. We are proud to be a part of the Perry Ellis Island community, and strive to make a positive impact in the lives of those around us.
